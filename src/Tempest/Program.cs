    // 1) Generator generates (out of thin air or by copying or by downloading or whatever) a stream
    // 2) Transformer takes the stream and does whatever (like changing all occurrences of 'Microsoft' into 'YourMom') and passes that on as new stream
    // 3) Emitter takes the stream and emits it wherever (like into a file, or maybe into github repo, trololo)
    // 4) Profit, because no steps are "???" =D

    // What does a template generator need?

    // Copy files from one location to another, possibly rename
    // Replace text (tokens) in files
    // Modify project structure (edit project files) - serialization?
    // Simple syntax
